## Notes

- Selecting a new member of the TSC
  - Professor Aric LaBarr (NC State University) was elected as a new member of the TSC
- Taxonomy of the GitHub repository
  - This is a crucial step in structuring the content
  - There is a need to look towards the future as the repository grows in content
  - It must be clear, easy to navigate and have not too many empty (non-populated) categories
  - Keywords and tagging (keyword tagging) may be useful to search for content
  - TSC members will provide suggestions on how to simplify the proposed taxonomy/topology
  - Taxonomy will be reviewed again during the next TSC meeting
- What constitutes a module/lesson
  - Set of PowerPoint slides, Jupiter Notebook and presenter notes and optionally a quiz? Need to clarify
- Governance being rewritten for this project 
- Next meeting in two weeks
