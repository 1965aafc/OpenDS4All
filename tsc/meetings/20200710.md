## AIs

- Goutam and Andre to review Jupyter Notebooks on Binder

## Notes

- Google search
  - Will look at Forks made of the OpenDS4All repository to try and infer who uses the content
- Binder
  - Adding a link to Binder seems like a good idea
  - Notebooks need to work correctly
  - Do not want to put extra hurdles in front of faculty
  - A bad first impression is unacceptable
  - Need to add instructions/modify notebooks
  - Check whether each notebook executes without errors and note what needs to be changed for correct execution
