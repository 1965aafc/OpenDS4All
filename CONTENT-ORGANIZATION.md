## Open Data Science for All Content Organization
  
The OpenDS4All content is organized in a hierarchical structure containing the following categories:

**[opends4all-resources](opends4all-resources)** - contains the opends4all curriculum building blocks organized by category
  * **[opends4all-overview](opends4all-resources/opends4all-overview)** - provides an overview of the topics in the OpenDS4All curriculum, including big data, data science, and data engineering.
  * **[opends4all-instructor-resources](opends4all-resources/opends4all-instructor-resources)** - includes materials for helping instructors plan curricula, set up a computing environment, and so on.
  * **[opends4all-foundation](opends4all-resources/opends4all-foundation)** - contains modules on the foundation of data science, including mathematics, statistics and computer science
  * **[opends4all-data-wrangling-and-integration](opends4all-resources/opends4all-data-wrangling-and-integration)** - contains modules on data access, data preparation, data transformation and data integration
  * **[opends4all-exploratory-data-analysis](opends4all-resources/opends4all-exploratory-data-analysis)** - contains modules on data summarization and visualization
  * **[opends4all-data-and-knowledge-modeling](opends4all-resources/opends4all-data-and-knowledge-modeling)** - contains modules on data and knowledge modeling (models for storage of data as well as computer interpretable models of knowledge)
  * **[opends4all-scalable-data-processing](opends4all-resources/opends4all-scalable-data-processing)** - contains modules on parallel and distributed processing as well as big data
  * **[opends4all-machine-learning](opends4all-resources/opends4all-machine-learning)** - contains modules on supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, reinforcement and deep learning
