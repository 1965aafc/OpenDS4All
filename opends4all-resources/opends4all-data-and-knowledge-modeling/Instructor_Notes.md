# Data and Knowledge Modeling

Representing and codifying knowledge -- using a combination of logical constraints and notions of classes, instances, and types -- is at the heart of data science.  Whether nodes and edges in a graph, tables in a spreadsheet, or feature matrices in machine learning -- one must be able to codify data and its properties in a structured fashion.  This module covers the essentials of knowledge representation, knowledge graphs, and, most prominently, schema design.
