# Instructor Notes: Scalable Data Processing

## LinkedIn Dataset 

The Lecture Notebook and associated Homework use a synthetic LinkedIn dataset.  Note that the Lecture slides were run over a real instance of LinkedIn which, due to privacy concerns, is no longer publicly available.  We have therefore generated a synthetic dataset which is used for the associated Lecture Notebook, so the results will be different from those shown in the slides.
